  const router = useFastRouter();
  
  // Navigation with caching and transitions
  const handleNavigation = () => {
    router.push('/target-page', { 
      prefetch: true,
      cache: true 
    });
  };
  
  return (
    <FastLink 
      href="/target-page"
      prefetchOnHover
      prefetchOnViewport
    >
      Navigate
    </FastLink>
  );
}
```
