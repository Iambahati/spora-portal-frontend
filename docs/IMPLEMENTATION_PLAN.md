2. Move `signin.tsx`, `signup.tsx`, `forgot-password.tsx`, `reset-password.tsx` into it
3. Update imports in `/router/app.tsx`:
   ```tsx
   // Old imports
   import SignInPage from './pages/signin'
   
   // New imports
   import SignInPage from './pages/auth/signin'
   ```
4. Verify all routes still function correctly after restructuring
